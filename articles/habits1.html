        This will probably not be my only write about habits. Habits are routines that one follows, automatically. They should not require conscious and purposeful choice -- instead, they should just be.

In his book Atomic Habits, James Clear asserts habits are the building blocks of any result. He illustrates this fact with many models, but the one that is most striking is the mathematical one. The one with exponential growth, and decay. It shows how incremental growth -- even just 1% a day, can result in dramatic changes over time. In fact, such marginal changes over a year can be the difference between a 37 times increase in production or a near-zero nose-dive.

It is for this reason that habits are so important. However, their minuscule nature also makes it insanely difficult to detect and slide under the rug when missing a good habit -- or potentially worse, repeating a bad habit. Doing something once will not hurt that dramatically. However, as we've seen, repeating such mistakes can compound into an avalanche of consequences later on.

In fact, the results in your life are simply lagging displays of your habits. Your bank balance is a lagging display of your financial habits. Your academic performance is a lagging display for your study habits. While this is powerful, I also see this as the sole reason for why it is difficult to build habits -- undergoing good or bad habits does not come with immediate gratification or ramifications. Instead, these results only display long after, where the immediate reward and punishment will no longer be linked to the cue and cause. Hence, the development of such habits is insanely difficult. That is what I have come to realize today, and even though I need to wake up in 4 hours, I am still pushing through to write this entry. What is more concerning is that this is only the second day I am following this plan, so I am a little worried for what is in store for me in the future if I have these difficulties maintaining habits for the second day.

Moreover, it is reflective of what inspires me to do things -- one off, motivations. Often times I find myself promising to achieve an ambitious goal that requires great effort. It does seem that I do follow with that effort in the first day. However, it quickly spirals into oblivion as the days go by. Hence, I need to somehow automate this, and turn it into something I am able to do, without the need of unnatural and irregular motivation that comes unpredictably. Instead, I should rely on a system that can push me towards performing these beneficial habits that occur systematically and consistently, eliminating the possibility of missing good habits and pursuing bad ones. That is the takeaway for today, and I hope I can carry this lesson forward.
