    <p>They say confidence is key. I could not agree more. Today I went on adventure to volunteer at the Abbotsford International Airshow. It was great, especially in the morning when no one was there, and I had the opportunity to exploit my volunteer status. I went on many planes that were closed off to the public before the gates opened, talked to many military staff, and even faked being a pilot. Honestly, it was just bamboozling my way through it all. I could shapeshift my character into whatever I desired, to best suit the needs of the circumstance at that exact moment. I adapted, from being a humble volunteer under an instructor, to randomly pointing directions to strangers who looked at me like I was supposed to know it all. Honestly, it is just confidence. As long as I look like i know what I was doing, people would think I knew what I was doing. The orange vest enhances this power tenfold. Equipped with the gear, with chin high, I could walk across the field almost like I ran the place. It felt so freeing, to be able to do whatever I wanted to.

        However, I don't think any power of any sort that being a volunteer grants can beat out the sass and the intimidation that military personnel give off. They, unlike me, actually run the place. The airshow would not happen without them. People are here to see them. Whats more, is when I got close up and talked to them, they were so relaxed. So different from the standard portrayal of all serious sentiments that movies portray. They look like old  teenagers who love enjoying the privilege of being in the military. "I can do whatever the fuck i want.", "i am so drunk", sitting on the wing of the plane as the sun sets and drinking beer, all in millitary uniform, it was such a vibe. I was only able to watch from afar, but that was truly a sight to see. It was so inspiring, I was almost persuaded to serve a year in the military just for the vibes.
        
        Either way, the overall takeaway from both events -- the volunteering and seeing the military -- is to have the confidence that you run the place. That is what enables you to actually run the place. If you don't even believe in yourself, who will? Contrarily, believing in yourself is the first step into persuading all that you are competent. Let this lesson sink in and dictate how you carry your chin from now on.</p>
