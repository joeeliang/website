    <p>
        Living together with different occupations may seem challenging at first. There may seem to be little to converse about. But seeing my parents, I find that it is much more achievable than I expected. Despite my parents having different occupations (my father in trades and my mother in corporate) they seamlessly talk about their work a lot. The trick is to be enthusiastically interested about the other's life. Often times, I find my dad curiously listening to my mom talk about her corporate struggles as a manager. While I am unsure if the curiosity is genuine, I am certain his attention makes my mom happy. Perhaps we should open our minds to each other's fields to facilitate this healthy blend. If we grow curious to each other's ideas, we will both live in joy. Joy in seeing the other's enthusiasm, and joy in expressing your own thoughts to our beloved.
