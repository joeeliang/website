        War is peace -- a phrase that seems ironic and contradictory at first, but the significance and reality that is tied into it is very much justified in George Orwell's 1984.

        In this time, the main character Winston is confined in a super-state that is bounded to continuous warfare against two other super-states. In his life, he is taught to hate the outsiders, the grotesque and nasty creatures that are not himself.
        
        However, unbeknownst to him, such hatred and warfare is by design of the ones in the higher circles in the hierarchy of this world. Such continuous warfare is the means in which they preserve power, maintaining the stability of their iron-grip control.
        
        Society at this time is at a place where technological advancement is very achievable. If desired, the quality of life can increase tremendously across all different social classes. However, when this is achieved, the inequality between different classes would be eliminated. Small advantages in standards of living would be eliminated, and soon the lower classes will see that the privileged minority serves no purpose, erasing the class as a whole and overthrowing the hierarchical structure of society. Thus, the use of resources in improving standards of living will prove to be detrimental to the ruling class.
        
        Constant warfare is the solution to this problem. War is an endless void where resources will be sunken into the endless ocean, with pieces of iron flung into outerspace and evaporated in use. It is this black hole of consumption that ensures the resources that are spent on civilians, and by product, their standard of living, stays at a minimum. This way, inequality is exacerbated, and the dynamic of skewed power will be maintained.
        
        Moreover, warfare provides a psychological effect on top of depleting resources that an alternative, such as burning away resources, cannot achieve. It strikes fear and hatred into civilians, making handing over power to a selectively small group much more natural. In this way, the terrors of war is exploited to distill and maintain power at the tip of the social hierarchy.
        
        The way such sentiments of hatred and fear can be maintained is through the censorship methods from the party. Orwell shows that such control over the people through the means of censorship of ideas is how concentrated power is maintained. An example of this is how the party restricts its citizens from coming into contact with other citizens of other states. The reason being, when the citizens who suffer from their respective regimes meet, they will find that they are no different than one another. They are not as gruesome and nasty as the party paints them out to be. In fact, they are all the same. This breaks the entire illusion of hatred that sustains the continuous warfare the super-states are in. On top of that, the party restricts thoughts and ideas through the means of censoring language. Certain ideas that have potential to overthrow the party, such as scientific advancement, have become outdated in newspeak, the language of Oceania. If such an idea cannot be communicated, how can it be realized? By using specific examples of censorship, Orwell shows how censorship is the pillars for dictatorships and absolute control, destroying all possibility of ideas that allow for new thoughts and ideas, forcing down a singular truth into the people that is forged by the party. Such a society draws terrifying parallels to the modern world, where censorship has become prominent and the freedom of speech is more inhibitted than ever. In a world where vast amounts of data are stored online, it is easier than ever to block and manipulate information. By showing the means and effects of censorship through describing the state of Oceania, Orwell reminds the audience of the dangerous effects of censorship, and the importance of knowing.
        
        While it is true that in this world, the continuous and constant struggle of resource-depleting warfare can lead to sustained peace among citizens, it is not a form of peace that is truly serene and pure. Sealed in an envelope of lies where censorship dicates all, and truth is eroded, it is not the true desire of man. Instead, true peace comes from the understanding of the truths of the world, of transparency and understanding, of forward movement, of advancement. The peace the party holds can ensure the livelyhoods of the citizens. However, they will be forever stuck in the constant and unmoving cycle of impovershment and stifled progress. It is in this way that contrasts and brings out the importance of a peace that is advancing and forward moving. One that is innovative. One that is true. 
        
        By reminding us of the horrors of censorship and its abillity to create a world of lies, Orwell encourages us to be aware of the dangers of censorship. To focus and be aware of the misinformation around us, to be aware of the erosion of truth. It is only in this way, to become aware, to have the realization of truth, can progress be obtained.
